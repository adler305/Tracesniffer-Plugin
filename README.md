# Tracesniffer-Plugin

![Tracesniffer-logo](Logo/TraceSnifferLogo_small.png)

We recently made a huge update to our TraceSniffer and the documentation and some guides aren't up to speed yet. This GitHub-Page is therefore under *maintenance*. 


The Tracesniffer-Plugin is the part of Tracesniffer which has to be on the traced system. We tried to make it as compact as possible, and as general as it can be, so its lightweight and can work on any system.
In combination with the [Tracesniffer-Frontend](https://github.com/Penlane/Tracesniffer-GUI) it provides a basic tool for tracing FreeRTOS systems. 

It is not intended and wont be able to replace professional tools.

For the plugin itself look under Source.
For examples (which we hopefully can provide more and more of over time) look under Examples.
