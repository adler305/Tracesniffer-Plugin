# Tracesniffer-Plugin

![Tracesniffer-logo](Logo/TraceSnifferLogo_small.png)

We recently made a huge update to our TraceSniffer!

TraceSniffer is a utility which allows makers and hobbyists alike to analyze their FreeRTOS system. It collects data from the system, like when did a task switch in or switch out or when a queue is read.

The Tracesniffer-Plugin is the part of Tracesniffer which has to be on the traced system. We tried to make it as compact as possible, and as general as it can be, so its lightweight and can work on any system.
For further information and all documentation, check out the [Tracesniffer-Frontend](https://github.com/Penlane/Tracesniffer-GUI) where you can find the GUI.

It is not intended and wont be able to replace professional tools.

For the plugin itself look under Source.
For examples (which we hopefully can provide more and more of over time) look under Examples.
